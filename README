COMPILING

If you're not content with just reading the code and want to compile it, here's
how. First you need the libraries that Lex4 uses. Allegro and DUMB, get them 
on their web sites:
	
	http://alleg.sf.net	and	http://dumb.sf.net
	
How to install and configure the libraries should be covered in the help files
that comes with the download of each library.

There, having installed libraries, just compile all the source files. Make sure
that you maintain the directory structure so that the c-files can find the 
h-files that they need (mostly in the data/ directory).
